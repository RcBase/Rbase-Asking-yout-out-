      <h1>Will You Go Out With Me????  ðŸ¤—</h1>
      <p>I used to beleive love was a set in stone, and fate was its stonemason. That perhaps, things such as soulmates, love at first sight, tied red knots, were all true and as a result of fate. But no, I don't think we met and have this kind of connection because it was preordained. I wont let fate take credit for what we did. It was me who looked for you out of the 8.2 billion, it was you who respond, and it was us who continued. SO YSABELLE CAGUIMBAL RESPECTFULLY WILL YOU GO OUT WITH ME ? BECAUSE I LIKE YOU WITH INTENTIONS, NOT BY CHANCE        </p>
